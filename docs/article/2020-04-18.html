        <h1>Not Idaho, But Not Bad</h1>
        <h4 id="author-name">By Alex Street</h4>
        

  
    
<p>Humans have a deep-seated desire for certainty and control. That is, the more in control we feel, the more secure we feel about reaching or experiencing a desired outcome, and we use this to drive our actions. Except sometimes, all you can do is go with the flow when that sense of security and control are removed.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Unusual March snow storms from the Northwest and rapidly shifting weather, caused two buddies and I to ditch a backcountry Idaho trip two hours before takeoff. Instead, we decided to explore what Utah had to offer with the promise of slightly better conditions. Suddenly, we were descending on a chilly Saturday night in Salt Lake City, with nothing more than the bags on our backs, and high spirits for what lay ahead.</p>

  

  
    
<p>For the next week, we hiked, drove, climbed, camped and explored through the frozen tundra of Fishlake National Forest, Capitol Reef NP, The Grand-Staircase Escalante, Canyonlands NP, Moab and Arches NP. We spent countless brutal miles trekking through deserts, snow, mountains, lakes, forests, grasslands and everything in between.</p>

  

  
    
<p>After freezing ourselves out of Fishlake, we pushed our way down to the hidden treasure of Capitol Reef National Park. Ahead of us lay a staggering 15 mile trek through a cathedral of red rocks. Around each bend were various arrangements of stone, sand and sediment, each intricately woven into coarse terrain. With water scarce in the park, we had to slip some iodine tablets in the creek water we found. There were many times our legs were begging for breaks, but we had to tighten our straps and push on. Mornings started early, days went long and our muscles took a beating as we made our time here count.The canyon walls weren't going anywhere and neither was the harsh sun, leaving us exposed to the elements. All we could do was grit our teeth and push on.</p>

  

  
    
<p>We were worn to the bone here as we stuck our hands out in hitchhiker fashion, hoping to get picked up. After a few failed attempts, and just before the blisters made us cave in, a dude named Hunter snagged us.</p>

  

  
    
<p>The Grand Staircase Escalante was arguably the best view Utah had to offer. Slot canyons so close they hugged us above golden fields of every color. Brooks swam circles around us, and massive plateaus seemed to monitor our every move.  All sorts of unique biomes collided here from snow to desert to lush evergreen forests. The Grand Staircase had something unique for each person and was ideal for a little taste of the remote world.</p>

  

  
    
<p>From The Grand Staircase, we made our way towards Eastern Utah. With two national parks and the mecca of the mountain-biking and base-jumping worlds, this area had plenty to offer for those who are bold.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Arches. A triumphant piece of Roman architecture, and the natural windows to the west.  We hiked, climbed, jumped and explored through each one to see what views they had to offer.   From deep blue to cotton candy, the sky enveloped the rocks with a spectacle of colors. We almost tried to catch the clouds and bottle them up so later on we could experience it all again.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Utahâ€™s freezing nights, dark canyon walls, scorching days, little water, high winds, changing landscapes, hitchhiking and low service are not for the faint of heart. The scenery is incredible with swirling colors and smooth textures that rise out of the ground all around you. With slot canyons that almost hug you, crystal clear lakes and waterfalls at every bend, rolling colorful grasslands and lush forests that consume each mountain range, Utah has a little bit of everything.</p>

  

  
    
<p>I think that sometimes the best things happen when you have the least control. This removes expectations, removes a level of comfort and invites in new and challenging experiences for all involved. Utah is a wonderful place with a variety of fun things to do, not to mention the incredible people you'll meet along the way. Far beyond the time you spend here are the memories that get created. Until next time.</p>
